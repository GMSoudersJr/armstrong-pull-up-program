# ðŸ¦¾ Armstrong Pull-up Program

A 5-day program to increase your pull-up ability drastically within 6-8 weeks.

I have personally used this program to go from a max of 3 pull-ups to 27 along with 5 muscle ups!
It is recommended to do it for at least 6 weeks to reap the rewards. I did mine for about 5 months.

## PROBLEM
I used to do pullups at a park and had to memorize my rep and set numbers during the walk home. This will allow me to keep track when I do them and have them saved locally.

After doing pull-ups, dexterity can be a problem, so the buttons should be large. The fonts should be easy to read and the input should be intuitive.

This is my solution!

## PLAN
- Have this be a local-first app.

- Most likely a Progressive Web App like Suit Yourself.

- Follow the program while I develop it to better understand the needs of users.
